** Samsung Galaxy Mini 2 - GT-S6500(D) device source / configuration for building CyanogenMod 10 (Android 4.1) **

The device configuration is still a work in progress. 
A lot of parts (mostly ramdisk) that are included requires cleaning.
Some things (like camera HAL) are just used as stub. 
As always, any help is appreciated.
